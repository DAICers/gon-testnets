## **Cosmos Game of NFTs Initiative**

#### **Summary**

Game of NFTs (GoN) is a program having public incentivized testnets and hackathons that will test the Interchain NFT Transfer (ICS-721) feature and help the Cosmos community prepare for this capability as well as explore applications. This event is expected to happen in Q1 2023.

#### **Background**

Supported by the Interchain Foundation, the Interchain NFT Transfer feature enables the IBC NFT interoperability between IBC-enabled chains and allows the building of various NFT innovations on top of that flexibly. 

NFTs have changed the way we produce, distribute, trade and advertise branded goods like art, movies, and music, attracting the attention of various industries, as well as stakeholders within the Cosmos ecosystem. Interchain NFTs are further expanding the size of the NFT market and unleashing the next level of NFTs in the Interchain. 

Interchain NFT Transfer can be adopted to serve various usage scenarios. We believe that through the joint efforts of different teams during the incentivized testnets and hackathon event, the community can prepare with this technology and also pioneer innovation, thereby providing Interchain stakeholders with valuable use cases. 

#### **Incentivized Events**

The Interchain NFT technology is complex and requires rigorous and extensive testing with joint efforts.

To activate the IBC NFT ecosystem, we are preparing the GoN with 2 Phases: 1) incentivized testnets for IBCgangs and service providers to test the capability and performance of Interchain NFTs, and 2) hackathon for developers to explore and build applications, tools and usage scenarios using this technology.

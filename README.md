Game of NFTs (GoN) is a program that provides public environments where the Interchain NFT Transfer technology can be extensively tested with community support and innovations can be created pioneeringly.

The program includes two phases:
- Phase 1 - Public Incentivized Testnets
- Phase 2 - Hackathon

Phase 1 of GoN will open for registration and kick off soon, and we have a number of tasks and rewards scheduled. Rewards will be distributed based on a point system, and allocated to winners who have completed certain tasks and submit an entry for dedicated awards. There will be a series of testing tasks and dedicated awards (more details to come).

To participate, please note that: 

- Employees of Organizer Teams (IRISnet, Stargaze, Juno) are eligible to participate, but ineligible for rewards. (There may be more organizer teams involving in Phase 1, according to future coordination)
- GitHub account has been registered more than one year.

## Overview

Through the several rounds, participants are expected to gain knowledge and build an understanding of the Interchain NFTs feature and assist in the discovery of interesting attack vectors.	

The testnet infrastructure will include:

- ICS721 SDK chain
- ICS721 Wasm chain
- IBC relayers
- Support services
- Faucets

Participants will utilize all GoN testnets for feature-testing, and for completing multiple tasks. Moreover, participants can also join the testnets as validators to compete for extra rewards.

There will be scoreboard, discord channel, and more supporting services to be provided during the event.

# Game of NFTs

Game of NFTs (GoN) is a program that provides public environments where the Interchain NFT Transfer technology can be extensively tested with community support and innovations can be created pioneeringly.

The program includes two phases:
- **Phase 1 - Public Incentivized Testnets (Kick Off Now!)**
- Phase 2 - Hackathon (April 2023)

Phase 1 of GoN now kicks off at **2023-03-01-06:00 UTC**, and we have a number of tasks and rewards scheduled. Rewards will be distributed based on a point system, and allocated to winners who have completed certain tasks and submit an entry for dedicated awards.

## Overview

Through the several rounds, participants are expected to gain knowledge and build an understanding of the Interchain NFTs feature and assist in the discovery of interesting attack vectors.	

The testnet infrastructure includes:

- [ICS-721 Enabled SDK and Wasm Chains](./doc/testnet-info.md#chain-information)
- [ICS-721 IBC Channels and Ports](./doc/port-channel-table.md)
- [Support Services in Cosmos Discord](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1074987031270268958)
- [Testnet Faucets](./doc/testnet-info.md#faucet)
- [Testnet Explorers](./doc/testnet-info.md#explorer)

Participants will utilize all GoN testnets for feature-testing, and for completing multiple tasks.

üí¨ Event coordinators will be available in the [Cosmos Network Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) #üêá‚îágon-testnet channel

üìç A leaderboard will be available at https://interchainnfts.dev/gon/scorecard.html

## Join & Evidence Submission

According to information provided via the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIhkXzOUTNu5R2cueCSt-_0Dic4MdsF193I9GSx64YTqNyWw/viewform), eligible participants have been invited into [Cosmos Network Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) #üêá‚îágon-testnet channel to start coordinating their participation.

Before you start testing, please kindly check the join & evidence submission guidance provided at [gon-evidence](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence).
 - Step 1. You need to submit [qualification evidence](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence#qualification-evidence-submission) to upload basic team information
 - Step 2. After that, you need to add each [task evidence](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence#task-evidence-submission) into your own `info` sheet as required and submit for verification and scoring
 - Step 3. For special award application, you should submit issues based on [award application](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence#award-application) for judging
 - Step 4. During the testing phase, if you find a bug/issue, please report based on [bug submission](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence#bug-submission)

In order to verify the authenticity of identity, ensure fairness of the game, and protect participants' rights in receiving points and claiming rewards, please make sure to submit evidence as required.

*Please note that all submissions will be public, so please make sure to **create new addresses of test chains** to participate in the public testing.*

## Disclaimers
 1. The final number of points awarded to each participant is at the discretion of the testnet judges.
 2. The timeline for all stages and rounds may change depending on the outcome of previous activities.
 3. Available tasks/awards and points may be adjusted during the course of the testnet program.
 4. All evidence submitted for scoring points must be submitted to [gon-evidence](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence) as required.

## Timeline

The Incentivized Testnets has 3 stages with different tasks. Tasks will be revealed gradually as the game progresses.

Participants can refer [the installation doc](doc/installation.md) to install the client software and [the instruction doc](./doc/instruction-ics721.md) to get familiar with Interchain NFTs Transfer operations.

### Stage 1: Welcome to GoN

Start from **Mar 1**

- Create Collections and NFTs
- Perform Interchain NFTs Transfer

**Round 1: Warm-ups**

IRISnet, Stargaze, Juno, Uptick and OmniFlix have prepared their testnets, allowing participants to create their collections and NFTs. These NFTs can be used for the next transfer tasks of the game, marking the first time participants can experience Interchain NFT Transfer.

**Rules:**
 
- Participant issue their own classes(collections, denoms) and must set class data as the JSON string below
- This allows participants to bind their classes to their GitHub account and prove they have control of the class owner
- All the following tasks related to NFT transfer must be minted under their classes
- Class owner must be the IRISnet address of each pariticipant at the time of registration

```json
{
  "github_username": "username, this is a must",
  "discord_handle": "discord handle, this is optional",
  "team_name": "your team name, this is optional",
  "community": "if you come from a community"
}
```

**Tasks**: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6


### Stage 2: Let's Dive into Interchain NFTs Transfer

Started from **Mar 6**

- Perform Interchain NFT Transfer through different flows

**Round 2: Journey for One**

Participants complete Interchain NFTs Transfer independently, which means they need to perform operations using their own account addresses on each chain. For each task, participants should start transferring with a different NFT. As a result, they need to create multiple NFTs under their collections.

**Rules:**

- Each NFT can only be used as evidence once for tasks in Round 2.
- Participants must use NFT minted under classes/denoms they issued in Round 1.
- Participants must use their own account addresses provided at the registration stage.
- Flow can be queried off-chain with flow-id.

**Tasks**: A7~A20


### Stage 3: Enjoy the Carnival of GoN

Started from **Mar 13**

- Competitive individual race
- Quiz game
- ...

#### **Round 3: Competitive Individual Race**

Participants receive NFT airdrops on IRISnet and perform Interchain NFT Transfer through specified flows in Task Data. The airdrop has two rounds: In the first round, all participants go through the same flow, and in the second round, all participants go through different flows.

The first round airdrop will start at around `2023-03-15-06:00 UTC`, and the second round airdrop will start at around `2023-03-16-06:00 UTC`. Before that, participants can prepare their strategies. Please make sure that you have been added to the `gon-evidence` repository and your information is correct, otherwise, you may not receive the airdrop!

**Task Data:**
```
{
  "type": "individual race round",
  "flow": "the flow id, check flow with flow-id on https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/flow-table.md",
  "last_owner": "the ultimate owner of this NFT",
  "start_height": "transfer before this height are considered invalid"
}
```

**Rules:**
- The `flow` can be queryied with `flow-id` [here](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/flow-table.md). 
- The `start_height` is the block height on IRISnet. Any transfer prior to the `start_height` will be considered invalid.
- Participants must use their own account addresses provided at the registration stage.
- The `last_owner` is an official address on IRISnet. After finishing the interchain NFT transfer, every participant transfer the NFT to `last_owner` then complete the race.
- Considering the time zone difference, the completion time is calculated by the difference in height between the last NFT transfer (to the `last_owner`) and the first interchain NFT transfer on IRISnet.
- The participant with the smallest difference in block height will rank higher, and in case of a tie, the ranking will be based on the height of the last transfer, with the participant having the lower height ranking higher.
- The end of round 3 will be at `2023-03-17-23:59:59 UTC`. The height of evidence will be considered invalid if completed after the corresponding block height.

**Tasks:** B1, B2, B3, B4

## Point System

### General Tasks

General tasks allow participants to fully experience the NFT-transfer functionality. The deadline for the general task submissions (stage 1&2) originally due on the 13th will be extended to around 27th, considering that more testing would be better.~~These tasks will be locked once the 3rd stage has begun.~~ Participants must submit evidence generated before then (based on the specified block height). Details of flow and flow style in the task description can be found [here](./doc/flow-table.md).
